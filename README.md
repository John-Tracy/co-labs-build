### An open source collaboration tool that is easy to deploy, all you have to do is plug in your MongoDB URI and deploy the files. 

### Once deployed, your instance of Co-labs will give you on-screen instructions to set you up with your administration account from which your application will be completely maintainable.

### When you have created your personal Authentication Key you can give it out to your users so they are able to create "User" accounts from which they can enjoy seamless messaging between various chat rooms "Labs" and a fully customizable account.
